I decided to do a deeper dive on Docker using the guided Play with Docker materials.

#### Docker for Beginners - Linux

##### Task 1: Run some simple Docker containers

Running a container:

 - `docker container run alpine hostname` runs the `hostname` command inside the `alpine:latest` image, which Docker automatically downloads. 
 - `docker container ls --all` - see all prior docker container runs
 - `docker container run -it --rm ubuntu bash` - start a container of the `ubuntu:latest` image running bash interactively, but removing the artifact after wards
 - `docker container run --detach --name mydb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw mysql:latest` runs the `mysql:latest` image in a background container, setting the root password via the `-e` environment flag, naming is `mydb`
 - `docker container ls` - see currently running containers
 - `docker container logs mydb` - look at logs from the container with the name `mydb`
 - `docker container top mydb` - get current running process
 - `docker exec -it mydb sh` - connect to a new shell process running inside the container with the name `mydb` 

##### Task 2: Package and run a custom app using Docker

 - `Dockerfile` - a spec to create a container
 - `docker image build --tag $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:1.0 .` - builds a new image from a given Dockerfile in the current repo, `.`, and tag it with the name `weisjohn/linux_tweet_app` and version `1.0`
 - `docker container run -d -p 80:80 --name linux_tweet_app $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:1.0` runs the aforementioned created image as a container with the name `linux_tweet_app`
 - `docker container rm --force linux_tweet_app` - removes the container from docker and forcefully shuts it down
 - `docker container stop` - stops a container gracefully from running, while keeping it
 - `docker container rm` - permanently removes a halted container

##### Task 3: Modify a running website

 - `docker container run -d -p 80:80 --name linux_tweet_app --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/usr/share/nginx/html $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:1.0` - run a container, mounting a shared directory
 - `docker rm --force linux_tweet_app` - turns off the container with the name `linux_tweet_app`
 - `docker image build --tag $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:2.0 .` - build another image based on the current state of the disk, tag it and run it
 - `docker image ls -f reference="$DOCKERID/*"` - list docker images which match the reference pattern 
 - `docker image push [name]` - push an image up to a container

#### Docker for devs

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9IYnEDSVEc - Docker for devs

 - `docker system prune` - remove all old 
 - `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml docker-compose-debug.yml` - docker compose files can be extended to allow for local debugging, which is awesome!
 - understand the docker "Builder Pattern":
    - put the build environment inside the container
    - 2 dockerfiles - 1 for building, 1 for the final image
    - requires a script to do `docker cp` to get the archive out of the first into the second
    - a new feature called "multi-stage" docker builds allows you to implement the builder pattern but within just one Dockerfile, ex:
      ```docker
      FROM maven:3.3.9-jdk-8-alpine as build-env
      COPY . /app
      WORKDIR /app
      RUN mvn package

      FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
      COPY -from=build-env /app/target/*.jar /app.jar
      CMD java -jar app.jar
      ```

#### Node.js w/ Live Debugging

https://training.play-with-docker.com/nodejs-live-debugging/

 - a docker-compose file can override both the command, and the volume
 - a really awesome end result was that I was able to use the *exact same container* between the `docker compose`-provided debugging system and the web application

#### Creating Effective Images



 - docker compose layers are read-only container layers which belong to the OS
 - there are thin read-write layers
 - more layers mean a large image - smaller images mean faster builds, faster deploys, smaller attack surface
 - use shared base images where possible
 - limit the data written to the container layer
 - chain the `RUN` statements
