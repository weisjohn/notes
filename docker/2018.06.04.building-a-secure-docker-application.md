# Building a Secure Docker Application

how to secure your entire development pipeline

## pipeline

dev => drcs => container registry => production servers

Docker Content Trust Service - allows you to sign 

## development

code got added into the version control system

we need signed keys

if you're not cutting out the entire class 

### secure your source

user auth
 - multi-factor auth
 - key-based auth

passwords on ssh keys

sign your commits
 - use hardware like yubikeys

regularly audit your organization, require / enable 2-FA

### validate your upstreams

pin your deps
 - go - vendor.conf, Godeps.json
 - python - requirements.txt
 - ruby - Gemfile
 - node - package.json

pin by checksum

you can have users register GPG keys w/ Github to ensure whether or not they have signed their commits

use publisher keys 

## CI

### CI is an island

verify everything on ingress
 - commit signatures
 - dependency checksums
 - dependency signatures
 - DCT - Docker Content Trust
 - signatures of base images

### CI is ascetic

Be minimal, be disciplined

 - do build minimal images
 - do not embed secret/sensitive data in images
 - do sign built images w/ Docker Content Trust (DCT)

Don't allow people to deploy any random images

## tech

install deps from scratch
run tests inside container

## Docker Security Scanning - DSS

find CVEs before you go to deploy
 - stop being reactive, get proactive
 - make compliance easier

get notified about new CVEs
 - automate the auditing of existing applications

Docker Trusted Registry

 - allows you to sign images
 - no need to trust the middleman

## Going to Production

What are you deploying?

 - use Docker Content Trust to only deploy signed artifacts
 - use Docker EE Signing Policies to guarantee applications meet your requiremens

## Least Privileged Microservices

don't: `docker run --privileged`
do: `docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=CAP_NET_ADMIN`

## Zero Trust Networks

only pairs of services should be exposed... "firewalls" between everything

## Least Privileged Nodes

Defense in Depth

 - isolate sensitive workloads to their own nodes
 - use docker secrets

## Immutable Infrastructure

mitigate entire classes of compromise

 - run read-only containers
 - use Docker Editions for <your platform here>

immutable containers are real

## In Summary

1. Secure & sign your source
2. Pin & verify your dependencies
3. Sign your artifacts w/ Docker Content Trust
4. Leverage Docker Security Scanning
5. Deploy onto immutable infrastructure
6. ... with Least Privilege configurations
