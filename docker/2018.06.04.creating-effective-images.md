# creating effective images

## how do layers work?

read-only container layers
thin read-write layer

more layers => larger image

smaller images, faster deploys

deploying 20x a day is hard when your image is slow

### reduce layers

 - use shared base images where possible
 - limit the data written to the container layer
 - chain `RUN` statements
 - prevent cache misses where possible

### cache

anything you can cache, you should

## dockerfile

a series of instructions which build a container

chose the right base

### when do I want a full base OS?

 - compliance
 - security
 - ease of development

fewer cache invalidations means smaller images

once you've invalidated a cache, you run every subsequent child instruction

move requirements in first, then install

`ONBUILD` - she kind of skipped over the details of how this works and why you should use it

## windows tools

`ConvertTo-Dockerfile` works w/ `.wim` of `.vhd` files

avoid installing packages w/ MSI

## back to the dockerfile

custom base container

## `USER`

every time you switch users, you're adding a layer

## avoid adding big files

curl, use, and then remove them

## langugage specific best practices

one to build an artifact, then one to run it

`FROM scratch` - an image w/ nothing in it

`go` - can use scratch really well

`node` - `.dockerignore` the `npm-debug.log` file


## build stages

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu as build-env
RUN apt-get install make
ADD . /src
RUN cd /src && make
```

do the build environment ^
then use it below

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
COPY --from=build-env /src/build/app /usr/local/bin/app
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT /usr/local/bin/app
```

## docker security scan

`docker image prune -a` or `docker system prune -a`

garbage collection

## but wait, there's more!

 - build your own OS w/ *nix
 - unikernels for Docker
 - always new, more minimal base images designed for containers: `rancher`, `alpine`

## review

 - share layers
 - chose or build your base wisely
 - not all languages should build the same
 - keep it simple
